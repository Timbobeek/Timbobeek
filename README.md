My name is Tim, and I am a full-stack developer committed to continuously improving my programming skills at a job that I enjoy and where I can make a meaningful contribution. I previously studied Psychology and Sociology at the University of Iowa, driven by a desire to better understand people and strengthen my communication skills. During that time, I also managed a movie theatre, where I had the opportunity to apply some of that knowledge in a real-world setting. Due to the impact of COVID-19, I decided to switch careers and pursue software development - a decision I have never regretted.

Since then, I have worked on multiple projects, growing my experience in frontend, backend and UI/UX. Testing, designing, and developing pique my interest, and I find excitement searching for solutions to coding problems by spending hours staring at the screen daily. Looking at things around me, I realize that almost everything has been created with the help of software, and therefore, with the help of someone who can understand it.
