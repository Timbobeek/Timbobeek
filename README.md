### What else about me?

Currently, I am a fullstack developer aiming to improve my programming skills, and land a job that I enjoy and where I am needed. Previously, I studied Psychology and Sociology at the University of Iowa with the goal to understand people better and improve my communication skills. Due to COVID-19 I decided to switch my career, choosing between tutoring, interpreting, and connecting my life with software development. After brief stints with each of the aforementioned over the course of a year, I decided to dive deeper into programming, which I believe is one of the best decisions I have made in my life.

What else about me? Well, I love sports, especially soccer and badminton, playing guitar and video games, and learning new languages. I am fluent in Russian and English, and I am actively learning Spanish, German, and Ukrainian. My goal is to be able to converse in 5-7 languages! Oh, and traveling, my most recent passion: I would love to drive through the entire United States, and then expand my travel to the rest of the world!

In the near future I want to find myself in the software development field. Testing, designing, and developing pique my interest, and I find excitement searching for solutions to coding problems by spending hours staring at the screen daily. Looking at things around me, I realize that almost everything has been created with the help of software, and therefore, with the help of someone who can understand it.
