Current Full-Stack Web Development student at BloomTech aiming to improve my programming skills and land a job that I enjoy and where I am needed. Previously, I studied Psychology and Sociology at the University of Iowa with the goal to understand people better and improve my communication skills. Parallel to that, I have worked at a corporate movie theatre for six years, five of them as an assistant manager, which improved my leadership and team management skills. One of the most important traits I have gained being a manager is being responsible for personal actions as well as actions of my staff and the facility as a whole. With Covid-19 happening in 2020, I have decided to switch my career and was choosing between tutoring, interpreting, and connecting my life with software development. After brief experience with all of them over the course of a year, I have decided to dive deeper into programming, which I believe, is one of the best decisions I have made in my life so far. 

What else about me? Well, I love sports, especially soccer and badminton, playing guitar, playing videogames and learning new languages. I am fluent in Russian and English, also learning Spanish, German, and Ukrainian. The goal is to be able to have a basic conversation in 5-7 languages! Oh, and travelling, my most recent passion: I would love to drive through all states and then head to the rest of the world!

In the nearest future I want to find myself in the software development field. Testing, designing, developing? Interested in all of them! I enjoy spending hours staring at the screen in search of a solution to a given problem, and the excitement of finding it makes my day. Looking at things around me, I realize that almost everything has been created with the help of software; and therefore, with the help of someone who can understand it. 

I believe that every one of us has something unique to offer, I want to discover mine and apply it to making this world a better place. I want to create.
