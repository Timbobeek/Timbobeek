I am a 𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫, with recent project accomplishments where I contributed to full stack component builds using RESTful APIs, JWT token authentication, and Jest testing to deliver responsive and interactive applications. I have experience with UI/UX design creation and solution integrations where I provided aesthetically pleasing design elements with responsive functionality. Additionally, I have optimized front end website features utilizing Styled Components, Js, CSS, and HTML Figma, Ant-Design, Yup, and more to improve site navigation and user experience.  

Previously, I studied Psychology and Sociology at the University of Iowa with the goal to understand people better and improve my communication skills. Due to COVID-19 I decided to switch my career, choosing between tutoring, interpreting, and connecting my life with software development. After brief stints with each of the aforementioned career roles over the course of a year, I decided to dive deeper into programming, which I believe is one of the best decisions I have made in my life.

I find excitement searching for solutions to coding problems by spending hours staring at the screen daily. Looking at things around me, I realize that almost everything has been created with the help of software, and therefore, with the help of someone who can understand it.
